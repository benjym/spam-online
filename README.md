Web interface for the python spam package

## Usage
[Go here to try it out.](https://benjym.github.io/spam-online/)

## Roadmap
 1. Get all of spam to compile with pyodide (currently a very very minimal subset). Currently this is managed by hand (see [NOTES.md](NOTES.md)). Eventually get the `spam` maintainers to support a pyodide build.
 2. Build a some custom web interfaces:
   - [x] a 2D DIC interface that relies on the camera of the device
   - [ ] a 2D DIC interface that relies on the user uploading images
   - [ ] a 3D DIC interface that relies on the user uploading images
